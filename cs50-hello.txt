Hello, world!

Today thanks to technology I am able to say "Hello" to
my online classmates. And...Hello, classmates!

I'm from Earth! It's a small but very intresting planet
in our Solar System. And today I live in Moscow, Russia.

I like science and programming and I enjoy learning new things.
I graduated Moscow National Research Nuclear University, department of
Physics and Electronics. Yes, I've always had a passion for science
and different electronic devices.

Now I work as an embedded system developer in a company which
develops operating system based on Linux for mobile phones.

I work near low level programming layer. It's a hardwaer and drivers.
And it's a main reason why I've decide to enroll the course.
I'd like to learn whole picture about the Computer Science,
algorithms and data structures.
I want to get a robust understanding of development in general.

My name is Aleksandr and this is CS50! Bye!
